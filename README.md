Binfo
=====

Binfo is a tool aimed to help make it easier to pick out relationships in
data.

Check out the [home page](http://jakesandlund.com/binfo) for a
nice introduction and demo.

TODO
----

- Add more documentation! Add more than a single comment in the codebase.
- Snap charts on mouseup when red line shows up. Probably only show the
red line if it is within a certain range.
- With dragging charts, make it possible to insert new lines. Also remove
empty lines.
- Fix Date filter boxes. Don't show?
- Change "Level" to show percent, and that way it can show how the
"given" setting is logarithmic.
- Permalink button.
- Reset all filters button.
- Fix the brush on compare charts. Nice resize handles too...
- Show percent in bar when hovering over bar chart.
- Round the filtering of bar charts when holding shift, or something.
- Disable window scroll when mouse is over the statistics list (when
adding charts).
- Use some of the additions to the Crossfilter library to do removing of
dimensions.
- Related to the above, but probably waiting until it gets on master, allow
disjointed selections on ordinal charts.
