<p>DataZooka is a tool to help find correlations in data. It's designed to make
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis">multivariate analysis</a>
(more than one variable sampled together) quick and easy.</p>

<p>This demo shows a sample of airplane flights: each flight's distance,
arrival delay, boarding time, etc. There are a number of questions that
DataZooka can help answer about this dataset.</p>

<p>How does the boarding time relate to the arrival delay?</p>

<p>Looking at only the late flights reveals that they occur later in the
day. (Filtering can be done with the <signal>filter</signal> buttons or by
dragging across the chart.)</p>

<p>Of the flights twenty minutes late or later, <signal>78.8%</signal> are
boarding at 1 PM or later. Flights that are both 20 minutes late or later and
leave at 1 PM or later include <signal>13.8%</signal> of all flights.</p>

<p>Viewing the comparison chart shows that <signal>63.3%</signal> of flights
arrive within ten minutes of their designated time. (Dragging a
<signal>box</signal> on the comparison charts shows the percentage in the
boxed area.)</p>

<p>Press either of the <signal>given</signal> buttons, and it will update the
chart to look as if there were an equal number of flights at each time of day
or arrival delay (similar to conditional probabilities). This demonstrates the
large difference between the answers to the questions:</p>

<p>"My plane leaves at this time, how late will it be?"</p>

<p>"My flight arrived this late, when was the boarding time?"</p>

<p>You can also see the degree of correlation by changing the
<signal>level</signal> sliders.</p>

<p>Some more relationships are: arrival delay vs. day of the week.</p>

<p>...only late flights.</p>

<p>...strongest correlation.</p>

<p>Time of day vs day of the week (late flights).</p>

<p>Distance vs arrival delay.</p>

<p>...given distance.</p>

<p>...given arrival delay.</p>

<p>...early flights.</p>

<p>Play around and see what you can find. First, use the <signal>Remove
All</signal> button to clear all existing charts.</p>

<p>Add charts using the <signal>Bar</signal> or <signal>Compare</signal>
buttons.</p>

<p>Remove individual charts using the <signal>X</signal>.</p>
